Interview Problem
For this problem we want to understand the candidates ability to utilize python to:

Load data
Explore data
Prepare for modeling
Create a model to predict species_short
Critique the model's output
Just a quick note about the data:

The culmen is the upper ridge of a birdâ€™s bill. In the simplified penguins data, culmen length and depth are renamed as variables bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm to be more intuitive.

To Load Data
import pandas as pd
penguins = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/ihom627/realtor_interview/penguins_modified.csv")


Exercises TODO:

STEP1) Explore Data

STEP2) Use summary statistics and/or plots to understand what the data looks like.

STEP3) Prepare Data for Modeling

STEP4) Transform the data into a state that can be consumed by the chosen model.

STEP5) Create a model to predict species_short. Please note that 2 hours are allotted for this activity.

STEP6) Critique Model, Now that we have trained a model, we want the ability to tell if the model is performing well.
